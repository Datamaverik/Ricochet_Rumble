Ricochet Rumble is played on an 8x8 board with the following pieces:

- **Titan**
- **Tank**
- **Ricochets**
- **Semi Ricochets**
- **Cannon**

### Movement and Rotation

- Any piece can move one tile in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or rotate once per turn.

### Objective

The goal is to destroy the opponentâ€™s Titan by shooting a bullet through a series of Ricochets.

## Power Ups
The Power ups can be accessed through the shop which is enabled when enough energy stars are picked up.

At the beginning of the game 4 energy stars will be available to be picked up. The energy stars keep reappearing at random intervals of time as the game progresses

### <u>Set-Trap</u>

 This Power up allows the player to set a hidden trap in any empty tile in the game board. The player who sets up the trap is immune to these traps. 

 Once the opponent player piece steps on the tile with the trap, it'll get destroyed.

 **Constraint:** The trap can't not be set on the extreme most rows to safeguard the cannon.

### <u>Teleportation</u>

### <u>Add Ricochet</u>

This Power up allows the player to add another Ricochet to the game board to any empty tile.

**Constraint:** Unlike the above two Power ups which can be activated any number of times, this Power up can only be activated once. 

### <u>Add Semi-Ricochet</u>

This Power up allows the player to add another Semi-Ricochet to the game board to any empty tile.

**Constraint:** It can also be activated only once by each  player.
